Part 1

(a) Introduction to React

React components:

JSX:
  Programming language
  Looks like HTML but compiles into JavaScript. 
  Compiles using Babel. 
  Easily embed dynamic content by writing appropriate JavaScript within curly braces.
  JSX is "XML-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed.
    eg. <br />

Multiple components:
  Core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialized reusable components.

props: passing data to components
  It is possible to pass data to components using props.
  eg.
  const Hello = (props) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>
          Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
  const App = () => {
    const name = 'Peter'
    const age = 10
    return (
      <div>
       <h1>Greetings</h1>
        <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
        <Hello name={name} age={age} />
      </div>
    )
  }

(b) JavaScript

JavaScript:
  The official name of the Javascript standard is ECMAScript.
  Transpiled by Babel.
  Javascript is sort of reminiscent, both in name and syntax, to Java.
  But the core mechanisms of the languages could not be more different

Node.js:
  A Javascript runtime environment based on Google's chrome V8 Javascript engine.
  Works practically anywhere - from servers to mobile phones.
  The code is written into files ending with .js and are run by issuing the command node name_of_file.js

Variables:
  eg.
    const x = 1
    let y = 5   
    console.log(x, y)   // 1, 5 are printed
    y += 10
    console.log(x, y)   // 1, 15 are printed
    y = 'sometext'
    console.log(x, y)   // 1, sometext are printed
    x = 4               // causes an error

  const : does not actually define a variable but a constant for which the value can no longer be changed. 
  let : defines a normal variable.
  var : use of var in this course is not advised.

Arrays:
  List-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. 
  Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. 
  Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, 
  JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them.
  eg.
    const t = [1, -1, 3]
    t.push(5)
    console.log(t.length) // 4 is printed
    console.log(t[1])     // -1 is printed
    t.forEach(value => {
    console.log(value)  // numbers 1, -1, 3, 5 are printed, each to own line
    }) 
    ^^ The contents of the array can be modified even though it is defined as a const. 
    Because the array is an object the variable always points to the same object. 
    The content of the array changes as new items are added to it.

  forEach : Iterates through items of an array.
    forEach receives a function defined using the arrow syntax as a parameter: =>
    forEach calls the function for each of the items in the array, always passing the individual item as a parameter.
      eg.
      value => {
        console.log(value)
      }

When using React, techniques from functional programming are often used. 
One characteristic of the functional programming paradigm is the use of immutable data structures.

Immutable data structures:
  In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object)
  is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.
  This is in contrast to a mutable object (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created.

concat:
  In React code, it is preferable to use the method concat , which does not add the item to the array, 
  but creates a new array in which the content of the old array and the new item are both included.
  eg.
    const t = [1, -1, 3]
    const t2 = t.concat(5)
    console.log(t)  // [1, -1, 3] is printed
    console.log(t2) // [1, -1, 3, 5] is printed

map method:
  Based on an existing array, map creates a new array, for which the function given as a parameter is used to create the items.
  eg.
    const t = [1, 2, 3]
    const m1 = t.map(value => value * 2)
    console.log(m1)   // [2, 4, 6] is printed

  eg.
    const m2 = t.map(value => '<li>' + value + '</li>')
    console.log(m2)  
    // [ '<li>1</li>', '<li>2</li>', '<li>3</li>' ] is printed
    Here an array filled with integer values is transformed into an array containing strings of HTML using the map method.

Destructuring assignment:
  A JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
  eg.
    const t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    const [first, second, ...rest] = t
    console.log(first, second)  // 1, 2 is printed
    console.log(rest)          // [3, 4 ,5] is printed
    ^ The variables first and second will receive the first two integers of the array as their values. 
    The remaining integers are "collected" into an array of their own which is then assigned to the variable rest.

Objects:
  Object literals:
    A list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}).
    The values of the properties can be of any type, like integers, strings, arrays, objects.
    The properties of an object are referenced by using the "dot" notation, or by using brackets.
    eg. 
      console.log(object1.name)
      console.log(object1[fieldName])
    
    You can also add properties to an object on the fly by either using dot notation or using brackets.
    eg.
      object1.address = 'Helsinki'
      object1['secret number'] = 12341

Functions:
  Defining arrow functions:
    eg. 
      const sum = (p1, p2) => {
      console.log(p1)
      console.log(p2)
      return p1 + p2
      }
  calling the function:
    const result = sum(1, 5)
    console.log(result)
  You can use the arrow function in functions containing a single expression.
    eg.
      const square = p => p * p
    This form is handy when manipulating arrays, e.g. using the map method.
      eg.
        const t = [1, 2, 3]
        const tSquared = t.map(p => p * p) 
        // tSquared is now [1, 4, 9]
  Defining functions: 2 ways
    function declaration:
      The function declaration (function statement) defines a function with the specified parameters.
        eg.
        function product(a, b) {
        return a * b
        }
        const result = product(2, 6)
        // result is now 12
    function expression:
      The function keyword can be used to define a function inside an expression.
      There is no need to give the function a name and the definition may reside among the rest of the code.
      eg. 
        const average = function(a, b) {
          return (a + b) / 2
        }
        const result = average(2, 5)
        // result is now 3.5

(c) Component state, event handlers

Destructuring: 
  The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to 
  unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

Page re-rendering:
  ReactDOM.render

Stateful components:
  React State Hook

Event handling:
  a user's interaction with the different elements of a web page can cause a collection 
  of various different kinds of events to be triggered.

Event handler is a function:

Passing state to child components:

Changes in state cause rerendering:

Refactoring the components:


(d) A more complex state, debugging React applications

Complex state:
  useState function multiple times to create separate "pieces" of state.

Handling arrays:

Conditional rendering:

Old React:

Debugging React applications:

Rules of hooks:
  useState function must not be called from inside of a loop, a conditional expression, 
  or any place that is not a function defining a component. 
  This must be done to ensure that the hooks are always called in the same order, 
  and if this isn't the case the application will behave erratically.
  hooks may only be called from the inside of a function body that defines a React component

Event handling revisited:
  eg. Clicking of a button to reset stored value.
  Event handlers must always be a function or a reference to a function.

Function that returns a function:
  Another way to define a event handler is to use function that returns a function.

Passing Event Handlers to Child Components:
  const Button = (props) => (
  <button onClick={props.handleClick}>
    {props.text}
  </button>
  )
  The component gets the event handler function from the handleClick prop, 
  and the text of the button from the text prop.

Do Not Define Components Within Components:
  Never define components inside of other components. 
  The method provides no benefits and leads to many unpleasant problems.


Part 2 - Communicating with server

(a) Rendering a collection, modules

console.log:
  When you pass objects as distinct arguments separated by commas to console.log, 
  the content of the object is printed to the developer console as strings that are insightful.
    eg. console.log('props value is', props)
  This is preferrable to concatenation.
    eg. console.log('props value is' + props)

Pro-tip: VS Code snippets:
  i.e. shortcuts for quickly generating commonly re-used portions of code

JavaScript Arrays:
  Functional programming method.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

Event handlers revisited:

Rendering collections:
  notes.map

Key attribute:
  React uses the key attributes of objects in an array to determine how to update the 
  view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered.

Map:

Anti-pattern: array indexes as keys:

Refactoring modules:
